I occasionally need to create a text formatted listing of the files in a Windows file system directory for inclusion in another document. The script below will create a CSV file with the name, path, file dates, and file size for all files in a directory and its subdirectories. You can remove the –Recurse option to operate on just the current/top-level directory.

To run this script, you:

1. Open Windows Explorer and go to the directory you want to process – e.g. h:\work\dir-to-list

2. In the Explorer address field, type “powershell” and a PowerShell window will open in that directory.

3. Paste in the script below and press Enter to run it.

4. Grab the resulting test.csv file from the directory, check to be sure it has what you need, and send it to whoever needs it.
 

dir -Recurse | Select-Object Name, FullName, CreationTime, LastWriteTime, Length | Export-Csv "test.csv"
